## About

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my B.Tech from SRM and am in my 2nd year. From hating C.S. every second to spending 10 hours on my laptop ðŸ˜….

Honestly, itâ€™s not a motivational line to start with, but I love building projects, exploring new tech, and collaborating with others.

Thatâ€™s all, nothing too special. Maybe Iâ€™m building and shipping while youâ€™re reading this.

Thanks a lot for reading! ðŸ˜Š
