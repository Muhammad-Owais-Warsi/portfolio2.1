## About ℹ️

I’m currently pa 2nd year student pursuing the Bachelors degree. From **hating C.S. every second to spending 10 hours on my laptop** 😅.

Honestly, it’s not a motivational line to start with, but **I love building projects, exploring new tech, and collaborating with others**.

That’s all, nothing too special. Maybe I’m building and shipping while you’re reading this.

Thanks a lot for reading! 😊
